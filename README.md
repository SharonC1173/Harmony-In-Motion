# Harmony-In-Motion
Harmony in Motion is an artistic challenge which fuses two distinct music genresâ€”RnB and Afrobeats. The song runs for 212 beats (or 2 minutes 21 seconds) and was created within TunePad, a Python coding environment. This project was a personal experiment to embrace the challenge of musical creativity while working within a coding framework. By combining original code with TunePad sound libraries, the soulful rhythms and melodies of RnB are overlapped with the vibrant percussion and energetic rhythms of Afrobeats.

## Setup

Access the TunePad composition using the following link: https://tunepad.com/project/90492

## Usage

The TunePad link provided above can be pasted into any web browser, without requiring sign-in. Wait for all instruments to load before pressing play in the top right corner. If there are issues with the playback, press the stop button then press play again. Song may play repeatedly, so please note that it concludes after 2 minutes and 21 seconds (or 212 beats).

## Project Status

Project is complete

## Room for Improvement

- Improved mixing to create more seamless transitions between each instrument
