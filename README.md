# Harmony-In-Motion
Harmony in Motion is an artistic challenge where I fused two distinct music genresâ€”RnB and Afrobeats. The song runs for 212 beats (or 2 minutes 21 seconds) and was created within TunePad, a Python coding environment. This project was a personal experiment to embrace the challenge of musical creativity while working within a coding framework. By combining original code with TunePad sound libraries, I overlapped the soulful rhythms and melodies of RnB with the vibrant percussion and energetic rhythms of Afrobeats.
